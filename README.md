# Web_scraper_for_trending_news
Times of India is a popular news paper and is a third largest news paper in circuation within India. They also maintain a website which is a great source for news articles and blogs. This website has seperate sections for most popular, shared, read and trending news which can be used as a good source to find viral news. This web scraper scraped all the anchor links and texts in such articles.

This work involves running a custom script for extracting trending news from Times of India website. The scraper puts those articles in text files in the folder of "output". 

I have also incorporated LDA algorithm to find out the most used words and important topics within the corpus (a Bag of Words corpus). We can see the repeated use of words like corona, covid, positive, military becauuse of the things going on around the world.
