      "BEIJING/WUHAN: The number of hospitalised Covid-19 patients in China's Wuhan, where the virus first emerged before turning out to be a pandemic, on Sunday dropped to zero for the first time, marking yet another milestone for the city which was opened up on April 8 after a 76-day lockdown. The result has been achieved with the âhard efforts of medical workers in Wuhanâ and those who were dispatched to assist the city in the fight against the virus from across the country, said Mi Feng, a spokesperson for China's National Health Commission (NHC). The last patient in Wuhan was cured on Friday, reducing the number of coronavirus patients in the city to zero, Mi said, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The health commission of Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan, said that no new confirmed cases or new deaths due to Covid-19 were reported on Satuday. It said that 11 coronavirus patients were discharged from hospital after recovery in Wuhan. Hubei has so far reported 68,128 confirmed Covid-19 cases, including 50,333 in Wuhan. Hubei and Wuhan were in the thick of the coronavirus outbreak since early January this year, bearing the brunt of it. More on Covid-19  Coronavirus pandemic: Complete Coverage 21-day lockdown: What will stay open and what won't How to quarantine yourself at home Trust the newspaper for your daily verified news China officially said that the coronavirus was noticed in late December in Wuhan but announced severe measures like the lockdown of 56 million-strong province from January 23, which drew criticism from the US and other countries that it acted late, leading to its spread globally. There was a controversy about whether the virus, with the ability to transmit from human-to-human, emerged from the Huanan Seafood Market of Wuhan or escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) as alleged by the US. China has said that the coronavirus origin is a matter of science and it should be left to science and medical community to reach a conclusion. China also revised the death toll in Wuhan by 50 per cent amidst criticism that it is underreporting the cases. Local municipal authority said as of April 16, the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Wuhan was increased by 325 to 50,333 and the number of fatalities up by 1,290 to 3,869. The revised figure raised China's overall Covid-19 death toll to 4,632. The total number of cases as of Thursday stood at 82,692. Chinese Foreign Ministry officials said the revision was due to some late reports, omissions and inaccurate information in the initial stages. Officials said that over five million residents of Wuhan travelled out before the lockdown to avail the Chinese New Year holidays starting from January 24 which was cited as a possible reason for the spread of the virus in China and the world. China has highlighted the strong measures it has taken in Hubei like prolonged lockdown besides building 14 temporary hospitals and deployment of 42,000 medical personnel to contain the virus. The lockdown was lifted on April 8 after the virus cases abated. The 11 million-strong Wuhan city has not yet become fully normal due to the steady increase in asymptomatic cases. By the end of Saturday, the province had 572 asymptomatic cases under medical observation, after 19 new such cases were reported on Saturday, the local health commission reported on Sunday. Asymptomatic cases refer to the people who test positive for the coronavirus but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. They are infectious and pose a risk of spreading the virus to others. More than 200,000 people globally have died of the new coronavirus, including more than 50,000 in the US. It has infected nearly three million people across the world. DownloadThe Times of India News App for Latest World NewsSubscribeStart Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper! Order Now\n",

      "NEW DELHI: From affordable Covid-19 testing methods to robots delivering food and medicines in isolation wards, drones for sanitising large areas to UV-fitted containers for sanitising grocery items, various institutions in the country are following the innovation mantra to aid the fight against coronavirus. While over 20 technical and scientific institutions are working on developing a vaccine for coronavirus, IITs have already set up \"Covid-19 specific research centres\", encouraging developments in the innovation ecosystem. Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi has become the first institute in the country to develop an alternative clinical testing method for the virus, which has been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The current testing methods available are \"probe-based\", while the one developed by the IIT team is a \"probe-free\" method, which reduces the testing cost without compromising on accuracy. \"The method can be easily scaled up as it does not require fluorescent probes. The team is targeting large-scale deployment of the kits at affordable prices with suitable industrial partners as soon as possible,\" IIT, Delhi Director V Ramgopal Rao said. Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore are working on a tool for diagnosis of Covid-19, based on respiratory, cough and speech sounds. The tool, once validated, will offer a test that will pose minimum risk of exposure to healthcare professionals and give results faster than the current testing method. Meanwhile, a university in Rome is conducting a pilot run for a patented artificial intelligence-based tool, developed by three biotechnology students and a professor from Mumbai, which they claim can test Covid-19 through voice-based diagnosis using a smartphone. The tool is being tested by the University of Tor Vergata in Rome. It has already been tested on 300 individuals and has yielded 98 per cent accurate results. A special infection-proof fabric for usage in hospitals, low-cost coronavirus testing kits, isolation pods for coronavirus-infected patients, bubble helmets that can be an alternative for the traditional oxygen masks and pendants to raise an alarm on a breach of social distancing are also among the innovative ideas that have been given shape since the coronavirus outbreak in the country. IIT, Ropar has developed a trunk-shaped device fitted with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation technology, which it recommends be placed at doorsteps, and all items brought from outside, including grocery and currency notes, put in it for sanitisation. An IIT, Bombay startup has developed a \"digital stethoscope\" that can listen to heart beats from a distance and record them, minimising the risk of healthcare professionals contracting the novel coronavirus from patients. The data or the auscultated sound from a patient's chest is wirelessly sent to the doctor using Bluetooth, doing away with the need to go near to take readings, according to members of the team. IIT, Madras has come up with \"negative pressure medical cabins\" under the rapid shelter system, where one can quickly deploy a reusable medical cabin speciality for contagious diseases. Another product at an advanced stage is a surveillance wide-angle camera that can be installed at strategic public spaces to detect and alert people with high temperatures, then zoom in to detect for other symptoms. An IIT-Roorkee professor claims to have developed a software that can detect Covid-19 within five seconds, using X-ray scan of the suspected patient. The professor, who took over 40 days to develop the software, has filed a patent for the same and approached the ICMR for a review. A group of researchers at IIT, Guwahati has developed a drone for disinfection of larger areas, while another group has come up with a drone equipped with infrared camera, which can help in thermal screening of groups without human intervention and identify suspected Covid-19 cases at an early stage once the lockdown is lifted. \"The drone also has a loudspeaker, which can be used by personnel to monitor places, especially with a high disease prevalence, and give appropriate instructions,\" IIT, Guwahati Director T G Sitharam said. The death toll due to Covid-19 rose to 824 and the number of cases climbed to 26,496 in India on Sunday, according to the Union health ministry. The death toll increased by 45 and the number of cases by 1,554 since the ministry had last updated its data on Saturday evening. The number of active Covid-19 cases in the country stood at 19,868, while 5,803 people have been cured and discharged, and one patient has migrated, the ministry said.

      "NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said India's \"people-driven\" battle against COVID-19 is the only way for the country to overcome the pandemic, and asked people to shun any complacency that they will not be infected by the coronavirus because it has so far not affected the places where they live or work. In his monthly 'Mann ki Baat' broadcast, Modi said the country is in the middle of a 'yudh' (war) and asserted that people have to continue being careful and take precautions. His note of caution comes against the backdrop of the Union government and states relaxing lockdown norms to revive economic activities. \"I urge you not to get overconfident. You should in your over-enthusiasm not think that if the coronavirus has not yet reached your city, village, street or office, it is not going to reach now. Never make such a mistake. The experience of the world tells us a lot in this regard,\" he said. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updatesModi referred to a popular Hindi idiom 'Sawdhani hati, durghatna ghati' (accident happens when caution is lowered) to make his point. In his 30-minute address, Modi hailed states, emergency workers and civil society groups for their contribution in combating the pandemic, and said that the resolve shown by the people of the country has led to the beginning of a transformation with businesses, offices, educational institutions, medical sector rapidly undergoing new changes. With the country under a lockdown since March 24 midnight, he said India's people-driven battle against the pandemic will be discussed when the world discusses the crisis later. \"India's fight against the coronavirus is people-driven in the truest sense of the term. Along with people, government and administration are fighting it as well... This is the only way we can win over the virus,\" he said. Citing a Sanskrit shloka, he said. \"Fire, debt and illness, if taken lightly, grow again at the first opportunity, assuming dangerous proportions, so it is important to treat them completely. Therefore, in over-enthusiasm, there should be no negligence. We will always have to remain cautious.\" Lauding the contribution of people in terms of helping the poor with food and medicines, he likened the exercise with 'mahayagya' in which everybody is eager to contribute. \"We are fortunate that today the whole country, each and every citizen of the country, every person is a soldier in this battle and also leading the battle,\" he said. India's decision to export medicines needed by several countries, including developed nations, has earned it praise from world leaders, Modi said, noting that it did so as part of its ethos. The prime minister said wearing masks will now become a part of a civilised society and also exhorted people to stop spitting in public places, saying it was high time to get rid of this \"bad habit\" once and for all. This will not only boost our basic hygiene standards but also help in preventing the spread of the coronavirus infection, he said. The health crisis, Modi said, has made the world pay special attention to Indian heritage of yoga and ayurveda as people look to them to boost their immunity. Modi expressed confidence that the world will acknowledge the significance of India's traditional medicine system in a similar way it adopted yoga, and lamented that hundreds of years of foreign rule have resulted in Indians failing to realise their own strengths. Everyone in this battle is putting up a fight as per one's capacity and ability, and altruism has gained in strength in recent years, Modi said, asserting that he bowed to this sentiment. He asked people to join 'covidwarriors.gov.in', a digital platform that links volunteers, health professionals, representatives of civil society and local administration with each other to take care of relief works. Over 1.25 crore people are already part of this portal, he said. Airlines have clocked a distance of over three lakh km under \"Lifeline Udan\" project to deliver over five hundred tons of medical supplies to different parts of the country, while the railways has been running more than 100 parcel trains on close to 60 routes, Modi added. He also greeted people on Akshaya-Tritiya and noted that holy month of Ramzan had also begun. \"We should pray more than ever before so that prior to the celebration of Eid the world is rid of the coronavirus and we celebrate Eid with enthusiasm and gaiety like earlier times,\" Modi said, urging people to adhere to guidelines of local administration. The pandemic, he noted, has changed the manner of celebrating festivals all over the world, including in India. People recently observed many festivals such as Bihu, Baisakhi, Puthandu, Vishu and Odia new year while staying indoors, he said. The fight against the epidemic has also given people a fresh perspective to look at the world around them with the importance of sanitary workers and neighbourhood shopkeepers being realised like never before, he said. People used to think negatively of police but a humane and sensitive aspect of policing has manifested itself now as uniformed personnel has been helping those in need, he added. The prime minister hoped that there may be some good news in the fight against the coronavirus during his next 'Mann ki Baat' episode, usually the last Sunday of every month. He reiterated his advice to people to maintain a distance of two yards from each other to keep healthy. \"Maintain a distance of two yards and keep yourself healthy. 'Do gaz doori, bahut hai zaroori',\" he said.

      "NEW DELHI: Close to 6300 Indian nationals abroad have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, posing a serious logistical challenge to the government as and when it decides to evacuate Indians stranded overseas. The number has almost doubled in the past 8-9 days as it stood at 3,336 on April 16. The number of deaths of Indian nationals caused by Covid-19 abroad has also shot up to 40 from 25 during this period, official sources told ToI. The infections are spread over 50 countries. Singapore and Gulf countries together account for more than 50 per cent of the infections. Singapore, in fact, has now taken over from Kuwait as the country where the highest number of Indians - more than a thousand - are infected. Coronavirus pandemic: Complete CoverageHow to quarantine yourself at homeTrust the newspaper for your daily verified newsOfficial sources here said almost 90 per cent of Indians infected in Singapore were workers living in dormitories for foreign workers. They said the spread within the dormitories was expected. The Singapore government is said to be providing all medical and other assistance to the workers. Indian high commissioner Jawed Ashraf had earlier this month visited one of the dormitories where thousands of Indian workers live. Well over 2000 Indians have also been infected in Gulf countries like Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE. Hundreds of Indians are also infected in Iran. The jump in number of those infected - from 3336 to 6300 - in a little over a week is significant. The foreign ministry had first said in Parliament on March 18 that 276 Indians had contracted Covid-19 overseas. However, 255 of those were only in Iran, one of the worst hit countries. It took a month for the number to increase to 3336, as the government confirmed on April 16. After that though, it has taken the number just 9 days to shoot up to almost 6300. While the Indian missions remain in touch with local authorities to ensure proper treatment for Indian Covid-19 patients, it remains open to speculation whether or not they can return to India anytime soon. The government has so far avoided bringing back from abroad Indian nationals who tested positive for Covid-19. It has said that this is not because India lacks quarantine facilities but because of the extremely infectious nature of the disease and the risk involved in their travelling. The government, in fact, stopped operating evacuation flights altogether after the lockdown, asking indian citizens in advisories across the world - from southeast Asia to Europe - to remain where they were because of the lockdown in India.

Quoting experts, Gandhi said \"random testing is the key to beating the virus\". India has to scale up COVID-19 testing from the current 40,000 to one lakh tests per day, he said. \"Experts agree that mass random testing is the key to beating Corona.

Expressing similar a view, former prime minister Manmohan Singh said that without aggressive testing facilities, India cannot conquer challenges posed by COVID-19. Testing and tracing are the key to fighting the menace, he said in a video released by the Congress. \"There are problems with regard to the inadequacy of testing facilities and without more aggressive facilities of testing, we are not going to conquer this menace,\" Manmohan Singh said. Earlier, the Congress had shared the thoughts of various leaders in the video to resolve the current crisis relating to the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown. The leaders are members of a consultative group headed by Singh and formulate the party's views on various matters. They also stressed on the issue of humanism, protection and financial security to drive the approach to dealing with migrant labourers. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said the party should have a broad framework for protection of migrants. \"We must insist that migrants are protected. But, we must also acknowledge that state governments are actually going to be responsible for driving this thing. Different state governments might choose different methodologies to solve this problem,\" he said. Gandhi said, \"Our migrant strategy should include protection. The idea that you can tell the migrant that it is his problem, that has to be central. Movement of the migrant should depend on the two states and they should have a conversation.\" \"Testing and Tracing are the key to fight COVID19. Humanism, protection and financial security must drive our approach to dealing with migrant labourers. This is the only way ahead,\" the Congress said while sharing the video.

      "NEW DELHI: Raising the tax slab for super-rich and a Covid relief cess are among a raft of proposals that have been recommended in a policy paper prepared by 50 young tax officers which has been submitted to the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). Titled as FORCE (Fiscal Options and Response to Covid-19 Epidemic), the policy paper hasa string of measures to raise revenues and provide relief to the economy battered by the pandemic. Stating that in times like these, the so called âsuper richâ have a higher obligation towards ensuring the larger public good, the paper has recommended that this segment of the population can be taxed through two alternative means, both of which can be imposed for a limited, fixed period of time. It has backed raising the highest slab rate to 40% for total income levels above a minimum threshold of Rs. 1 crore or re-introduction of the wealth tax for those with net wealth of Rs. 5 crores or more. âAdministratively, the former will be simpler to implement. However, the revenue gain associated with both options should be worked out to see whether the gains attached with the latter option score better in terms of a cost-benefit analysis,â the paper read. It said that the additional revenue mop-up through either of the above steps is Rs 50,000 crores, this amount should be placed in a separate kitty, almost like an escrow account. The government can then identify 5-10 most crucial projects/schemes entailing significant expenditure, which are likely to have a decisive impact on reviving the economy. The costs attached with such projects will be worked out, and these projects should be listed on a government website, accessible to the entire public. The government should commit itself to the fact that the additional revenue raised through taxing the wealthy will only and only be utilized for these 5-10 projects/schemes. Additionally, the website should display a live spending meter against each of these projects/schemes, which will mention the expenditure incurred till date, it said. âSuch visibility over the direct and immediate utilization of resources is likely to ensure greater resonance and acceptance amongst those being taxed, and provide greater satisfaction and a direct sense of contribution to this populace,â the paper said. It also called for an an additional one-time cess of 4% on account of COVID Relief (could be called COVID Relief Cess) which could help finance capital investment in COVID Relief work. The extra revenue mobilized on this account could be between Rs 15,000 â 18,000 crores. To mitigate the extra hardship on the middle class, the cess may be made applicable only in cases where the taxable income is greater than Rs 10 lakhs, the paper suggested. It said that the government needs to spend considerably more to revive the economy; and it needs to raise additional revenue, but in ways that must not burden the already distressed common man. âThe CBDT has sought feedback from our field formations across India on the ideas for revival across various sectors of the economy. While the combined feedback would certainly assist in determining the way forward as we work to bring the nation back to health and the economy back on track, we have also received a paper prepared jointly by a group of 50 Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officers of the Income Tax Department on policies and suggestions for meeting the challenges that we may face. in the process. Working from home, they have come together to leverage their combined knowledge, experiences, and commitment to building a healthy, strong and prosperous India,â Prashant Bhusan, general secretary of the Indian Revenue Service Association said in his letter to the CBDT chairman and members of the board.

      "DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand Police said on Friday that they have allowed azaan (prayer call by mosques) in low volume during Ramzan, although this will be subject to permission from the district officials. Earlier, the state had prohibited the use of loudspeakers in mosques for azaan in the wake of the ongoing Covid-19 threat-induced lockdown due to which any kind of religious gathering has been banned. Police officials said that following requests by religious leaders of the Muslim community that azaan be allowed during Ramzan, it was being allowed in low volume subject to approval by the respective district authorities. Ashok Kumar, director general (DG), law and order, told TOI, âWith due permission from district magistrate and superintendent of police in the district, azaan will be allowed in low volume from mosques during the month of Ramzan. But community prayers and community iftars (evening meal to end fast at sunset) will be prohibited.â Kumar further said that the decision to allow broadcast of azaan in low volume was taken after a series of meetings held between officials and Muslim community leaders, adding that it was also decided that to maintain social distancing, âno one except the Imam will be allowed to go inside the mosque for the azaan.â He added that sirensâone in the morning just before first azaan and another in eveningâwill be allowed from mosques, again in low volume during the Ramzan period. âThe sirens were already used during Ramzan to alert people regarding prayers. The only change is that now they will be played out in low volume too,â said Ashok Kumar.

      "MANGALURU: The âSaree Challengeâ has been going viral, with social media flooded photos of sari-clad women. However, reports suggest that these pictures of women in their six yards of elegance can be used for catfishing. According to reports, Deepnude.com, a website that was under fire last year for creating fake nude pictures of clothed people is back. Cyber experts warn the âSaree Challengeâ pictures uploaded on social media give endless opportunities to cyber criminals using this website. âItâs time to not just stay home and stay safe, but also to be cyber safe,â said Ananth Prabhu G, professor, Sahyadri College of Engineering and Management and cyber security trainer.. The original version of DeepNude â a machine-learning application that replaced womenâs clothing in photos with an approximation of what they would look like underneath to create fake naked images of them â was seemingly abandoned after its developers, based in Estonia, realised, with the help of some online outrage, that their misogynistic creation could be misused. According to Prabhu, Deep Fake content is created by using two competing artificial intelligence algorithms â the generator and the discriminator. âThe generator, which creates the phoney multimedia content, asks the discriminator to determine whether the content is real or artificial. So itâs more like a war between the generator and discriminator,â he said. âAs the discriminator gets better at spotting fake video, the generator gets better at creating them. Now, the same technology is used to create DeepNude software, which uses a photo of a clothed person and creates a new, naked image of the person,â he added. There are tools that can detect Deep Fakes and Deep Nudes. âHowever the initial damage done cannot be reversed easily,â Prabhu warned. The fake photographs can either end up in pornographic websites or can be used to blackmail or harass women.

      "MUMBAI: Even as the first batch of 100 Sikh pilgrims stranded at Nandedâs Takht Sri Hazur Sahib during the lockdown left for their home states of Punjab, Haryana and New Delhi after a push from Punjab CM Amarinder Singh and a nod from Union home minister Amit Shah, the stateâs chief secretary Ajoy Mehta on Saturday asked his counterparts in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh to take back 3.5 lakh migrants from these states stuck in Maharashtra. Mehta said Maharashtra was willing to ferry the migrants to the borders of their states and hand them over. The Himachal and Haryana governments too sent Kashmiri workers and those from UP back to their home states on buses on Saturday. A total of 3,800 pilgrims from Punjab, Haryana and Delhi who came to Nanded on March 23, a day before the nationwide lockdown was put in place, have been stuck in Nanded. While the first batch left on Friday in buses, the Punjab government on Saturday despatched 80 buses which are expected to reach Nanded on Sunday and shift the other pilgrims back. The buses will cover a distance of 3,300km. Each bus has three drivers, one conductor and one policeman. According to reports, Mehta told his counterparts in the other states that if they agreed, the Maharashtra government would drop off migrants from their states at the borders of those states. Similarly, workers from Maharashtra stranded in other states could be dropped off at the stateâs border. A senior bureaucrat told TOI, âAjoy Mehta raised this issue during a video conference with the Union cabinet secretary. Mehta suggested states take responsibility for repatriation of migrants.â According to reports, CM Uddhav Thackeray had taken up the matter with the NDA government as well as with the visiting Central team, but there had been no response. Over 1,500 migrants had gathered on April 15 at Bandra railway station after rumours circulated that long-distance trains had restarted. Takht Sri Hazur Sahib is one of Sikhismâs holiest spots. After the extension of the nationwide lockdown, the pilgrims stranded there got in touch with Punjab CM Singh, who spoke to Thackeray. Thackeray told Singh he had no objection to the pilgrimsâ return but it would require permission of the Central government in view of the nationwide lockdown. The Punjab CM then took up the matter with Amit Shah, who granted permission for transportation of the pilgrims as a special case. After chief secretary-level talks between Punjab and Maharashtra, permission was granted and the Nanded collector was directed to grant a travel pass to the Sikhs. âWe have asked the pilgrims to follow social distancing norms in the buses. Accordingly, against the capacity of 52 passengers, only 35 will be allowed in each bus. We think that in order to send back 3,800 pilgrims, they may require more than 100 buses,â the bureaucrat said. Before the pilgrims boarded the bus on Friday, their medical examination was conducted and they were allowed to go only after they had tested negative for the novel coronavirus. âAfter reaching their destination, we expect they would stay in quarantine for 14 days,â the official said.

      "CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government has been making efforts for timely detection of positive novel coronavirus cases to break the chain, but Covid-19 has spread its tentacles in the state largely due to âsuper spreaders.â As per data compiled by the Punjab health department, 58 infected individuals, out of total 308 cases, were traced and isolated before they could transmit the infection to others. In the remaining cases, positive patients went on to infect many people, in some cases in dozens, making the containment process difficult for the health authorities. Nearly half of the total Covid-19 positive cases have been recorded in last two weeks in Punjab and most of them are linked to the âsuper spreadersâ in different clusters. Sample this: A 42-year-old panch of Jawaharpur village in Derabassi of Mohali district went on to transmit the infection to 37 people, including family members, close relatives and neighbours. He had been infected by a Tablighi Jamaat member. Similarly, a resident of Nawanshahr district, the first person to have died of the virus in the state, after returning from aboard infected 27 people, including his family members and 17 cases are related to a Jalandhar-based vernacular newspaper. As many as 18 people tested positive in sub-urban Rajpura of Patiala district. The infection is said to have spread from a hookah party. The police later booked two persons for organizing the party. A book supplier in Patiala transmitted the infection to 15 others while in Pathankot, a woman, another Covid-19 casualty, passed on the virus to 14 people, including her family members, neighbours and domestic help. A total of 19 cases are related to Tablighi Jamaat and 10 are their contacts. To put a check on further spread of the infection, the local administrations sealed all the clusters falling in their respective jurisdiction and conducted mass testings. âAfter panch was tested positive, Jawaharpur was sealed and 200 tests were conducted in the village of which 37 came out positive,â said Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan. Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the majority of the cases have come from particular clusters and the state has managed to keep things under control. âMajority of the cases have been reported from few clusters and we have managed to put a check,â said Sidhu. Highlighting the importance of early detection, Indian Medical Association (IMA) Punjab chapter president Dr Navjot Dahyia said the state government has started aggressively started testing people and has been able to contain the spread of the virus. âThe strategy has started showing results with more and more people being traced before they transmit infection to others,â said Dr Dahyia. In Punjab, a high percentage of asymptomatic people have tested positive and experts feel that infected people without symptoms might be the key reason for spread of coronavirus in the state. Following the protocol issued by the central government, Punjab health authorities initially focused on screening people coming from virus-hit countries and tested only those who showed symptoms, including their family members. Later, it started testing people who came in their contact, symptomatic and asymptomatic, both. About 73% of the positive cases reported in Punjab did not have symptoms of carrying the virus.

      "SRINAGAR/NEW DELHI: With around 300 terrorists reported to be waiting across the Line of Control in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) to sneak into Kashmir Valley, the Indian Army is taking steps to \"re-calibrate\" its counter-infiltration grid and counter-insurgency strategies to check the intrusion. Lt Gen B S Raju, who is commanding the strategically-located XV corps in Kashmir, has also asked his formations to take adequate precautions during patrolling along the Line of Control (LoC) in view of the coronavirus outbreak with the possibility of the infiltrating terrorists having infection not being ruled out. The field intelligence units of the Army coupled with inputs comprising HUMINT (human intelligence) and TECHINT (technical intelligence) indicate that around 300 terrorists, mainly of the banned Hizbul Mujahideen and Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT), are waiting across the border to sneak in, officials said, citing reports from Srinagar collated in the national capital. As many as 16 launch pads along the LoC had been activated in the recent weeks by the Pakistan Army and its external snooping agency ISI which included those located in difficult terrains like Nowshera and Chhamb from where the terrorists are known to enter the Gulmarg area of north Kashmir. The reports said Gen Raju has been regularly holding meetings with the formations to work on the re-calibration of Counter Infiltration Grid (CIG) to ensure that no terrorist gives the slip and reaches the hinterland after crossing the LoC. The increased attempts from across the border to push in militants are also being factored in by the Army in its new approach. In the event of an engagement at the LoC with the terrorists, the troops have been asked to handle any bodies with utmost care as they could be infected with the novel coronavirus, the officials said. The CIG has been made much more robust and the coordination among various security agencies in the grid smooth, the officials said, adding some changes have been made in the troop deployment which includes putting an additional layer of troops. Officials said a heavy concentration of terrorists was witnessed across Leepa valley, Athmuqam and Dudniyal, the same area in higher reaches of Keran sector in north Kashmir where a group of five terrorists had infiltrated on April 1 and who were subsequently neutralised on April 5. Five army personnel also lost their lives in the gunfight. The launch pads like Dumail, Sardari and Dhakki, which are normally activated in late summer, had also witnessed the presence of terror groups this time, the officials said. Among other launch pads that had seen presence of terrorists included Shardi, Neelum valley, Nowshera and even Chakoti, Khoja bandi and Haji Peer. These camps were used by the terrorists to sneak into the Uri army camp in 2016. As many as 19 soldiers were killed when four terrorists entered the camp on September 18, 2016. All the infiltrating terrorists were subsequently killed. This incident led to Uri surgical strikes in which the Army's special forces targeted the terror camps across the LoC.

      "HYDERABAD: Lockdowns may have helped in the containment of Covid-19 across the world, but not many know that a similar exercise was carried out in the princely state of Hyderabad and parts of British India to prevent the spread of infectious diseases like cholera and plague in the 19th and the early 20th centuries. Though the term âlockdownâ was not used then, British officials had believed that a âholidayâ with wages paid would help curb the notorious cholera that had created havoc in parts of British India in several episodes. They had also argued that âholidayâ (read lockdown) would boost the morale and health of people. The princely state of Hyderabad and the British India had their own versions of lockdowns, containment zones, migrant labour issues, isolation hospitals and special passes for movement in cases of emergency during plague and cholera outbreaks. Most of them resemble the guidellines being followed now to fight Covid-19. British India official records in the National Archives of India (NAI), New Delhi, and British India medical history archival data reveal that British and Nizam governments had suggested a lockdown as trains and caravans were considered as carriers of infectious diseases, particularly cholera. There was no nationwide lockdown, but curbs on travel and movement of passenger and transport vehicles including ships were imposed in parts of British India. âSpecial containment zones (then called cordon sanitaires) were create. They were manned by armed police and military personnel. Only those with special police passes (then called plague passports) were permitted to enter cities on the condition that they undergo sanitation drives and health check-ups every alternate day,â said INTACH city convener P Anuradha Reddy. Like the migrant issue now, the British India too had its own migrant workers problems but British and Hyderabad officials had shifted the workers to areas within three km of their homes to provide them work and monitor progress and containment of infectious diseases. They were also paid 32 days of wages in advance. According to File No. 120 of 1897 (Simla records), department of revenue and agriculture, GOI, available with NAI, during a conference held on March 20, 1897 at Allahabad, British officials had proposed a holiday (now called lockdown) for a month for workers to contain the disease and boost their morale and health. Workers in small groups of 500 each were shifted to their native places unlike now where migrant workers are kept at shelters far away from their states.

      "NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with chief ministers via video conference on Monday morning on the way ahead in the fight against the novel coronavirus, amid indications that the discussions could also focus on a graded exit from the ongoing lockdown. This will be the third video conference of the prime minister with the chief ministers after the spread of the COVID-19 in the country. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updatesSources in the government indicated that besides discussing the way forward in dealing with the pandemic, the discussion could also focus on a \"graded\" exit from the lockdown which is in place till May 3. The Centre and the state governments have been giving gradual relaxation in various fields and sectors to boost economic activities as also to provide relief to people. But some states are willing to extend the lockdown beyond May 3 to ensure that coronavirus cases remain under control. In his monthly 'Mann ki Baat' radio address on Sunday, the prime minister said the country is in the middle of a 'yudh' (war) and asserted that people have to continue being careful and take precautions. His note of caution comes against the backdrop of the Union government and states relaxing lockdown norms to revive economic activities. \"I urge you not to get overconfident. You should in your over-enthusiasm not think that if the coronavirus has not yet reached your city, village, street or office, it is not going to reach now. Never make such a mistake. The experience of the world tells us a lot in this regard,\" he said. Modi referred to a popular Hindi idiom 'Sawdhani hati, durghatna ghati' (accident happens when caution is lowered) to make his point. The Centre has now allowed neighbourhood and standalone shops, including those located in residential complexes, in urban areas to open during the lockdown. But those in the markets continue to remain shut till May 3. In rural areas, all shops, except those in shopping malls, are allowed to open. In a late night order on Friday, the Home Ministry also said malls continue to remain shut but markets in rural areas can open. However, opening of shops located in COVID-19 hotspot and containment zones, sale of non-essential items by e-commerce platforms and sale of liquor continue to be prohibited. In the last interaction on April 11, several chief ministers had recommended extension of the 21-day lockdown by two weeks, which was slated to end on April 14 earlier. On April 14, the prime minister had announced that the lockdown is being extended till May 3. Before the lockdown was announced on March 24, the prime minister had interacted with the chief ministers on March 20 to discuss ways and means to check the spread of the novel coronavirus.

      "NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that as the COVID-19 pandemic has come to plague the entire world, we have an opportunity to make this Ramzan a symbol of patience, harmony, sensitivity and service. \"The Holy month of Ramzan has begun. During the last Ramzan, nobody would have thought that we will have to face such a big crisis this year. But now when the whole world is facing this problem, we have an opportunity to make this Ramazan a symbol of patience, harmony, sensitivity and service,\" the Prime Minister said during his monthly \"Mann ki Baat\" address. \"This time, we should pray more than ever so that prior to the celebration of Eid the world is rid of corona and we celebrate the festival with enthusiasm and gaiety like earlier times. I am confident that during these days of Ramzan, by adhering to the guidelines of the local administration, we will reinforce our fight against Corona,\" he added. The Prime Minister stated that it is still very important to follow the rules of physical distancing in the streets, in the markets and in the 'mohallas' (neighbourhoods). He also expressed his gratitude to all community leaders who are making people aware of the two yards distancing and staying at their homes. He acknowledged the fact that coronavirus has changed the way festivals are celebrated in India and the world. He also appreciated the citizens for staying at home and celebrating several festivals amid COVID-19 crisis. \"Recently we celebrated festivals like Bihu, Baisakhi, Pothundu, Vishu, Odia New year. We saw how people celebrated these festivals with simplicity and good wishes for society by staying home,\" the Prime Minister said. \"Normally they would celebrate these festivals with their friends and families in a joyous manner. They would share their happiness outside their homes also. But this time everyone showed patience and followed rules of lockdown,\" he added. \"We saw that our Christian friends celebrated Easter at Home this time. Today, it is essential to abide by our duties towards our country and society. Only then can we flatten the curve of corona,\" he said.

      "As the national lockdown entered its fifth week, an unprecedented cross-country evacuation exercise to bring back migrant workers and other people stranded in different states appeared to gather momentum on Saturday with Punjab sending 80 buses to ferry back Sikh pilgrims stuck in Maharashtra and UP preparing to bring back at least 9,500 labourers from Haryana by Sunday. Around 100 Sikh pilgrims stranded at Takht Sri Hazur Sahib in Maharashtra's Nanded left for their home states of Punjab, Haryana and New Delhi after a push from Punjab CM Amarinder Singh and a nod from Union home minister Amit Shah. Chief secretary Ajoy Mehta asked his counterparts in UP, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh to take back 3.5 lakh migrants from these states stuck in Maharashtra. Mehta said Maharashtra was willing to ferry migrants to the borders of their states and hand them over. The Himachal Pradesh and Haryana governments, too, sent Kashmiri workers and those from UP back to their home states on buses on Saturday. A total of 3,800 pilgrims from Punjab, Haryana and Delhi who had come to Nanded on March 23, a day before the nationwide lockdown started, have been stuck there since. Even as the first batch of pilgrims departed, the Punjab government on Saturday dispatched 80 more buses that are expected to reach Nanded on Sunday to bring the rest back. Each of these buses will be covering 3,300km. In Gujarat, the first batch of 2,400 labourers from MP set off for their native state on 98 buses arranged by the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government. Chouhan said migrant workers stranded in Rajasthan had also started coming back. In UP, CM Yogi Adityanath set up a committee and directed officials to prepare a plan to create at least 15 lakh jobs to provide employment to migrant workers expected to return to the state over the next two months. A total of 2,224 workers returned from Haryana on Saturday on 82 buses and another 9,500-odd will be brought back till Sunday, officials said. \"The people who returned from Haryana belong to 16 districts. They have been taken to their respective district headquarters for institutional quarantine,\" additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi said. After 14 days, each person would be given a ration kit, Rs 1,000 and sent home where they will remain in home quarantine for another 14 days. Sources in Maharashtra said CM Uddhav Thackeray had taken up the challenge of repatriating migrant workers with the Centre as well as with the visiting central team. Over 1,500 migrants had gathered on April 15 at Bandra railway station after rumours circulated that long-distance trains had restarted. Thackeray had told his Punjab counterpart that he had no objection to the pilgrimsâ return, but it would require the central government's permission in view of the nationwide lockdown. Singh then took up the matter with home minister Shah, who granted permission for transportation of the pilgrims as a special case. \"We have asked the pilgrims to follow social distancing norms in the buses. Accordingly, against the capacity of 52 passengers, only 35 will be allowed in each bus. We think that in order to send back 3,800 pilgrims, they may require more than 100 buses,\" the bureaucrat said. Before the pilgrims boarded the bus on Friday, a medical examination was conducted and they were allowed to go only after they had tested negative for the novel coronavirus. \"After reaching their destination, we expect they would stay in quarantine for 14 days,\" the official said.

      "WASHINGTON/SEOUL: A special train possibly belonging to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was spotted this week at a resort town in the country, according to satellite images reviewed by a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, amid conflicting reports about Kim's health and whereabouts. The monitoring project, 38 North, said in its report on Saturday that the train was parked at the \"leadership station\" in Wonsan on April 21 and April 23. The station is reserved for the use of the Kim family, it said. Though the group said it was probably Kim Jong Un's train, Reuters has not been able to confirm that independently, or whether he was in Wonsan. \"The train's presence does not prove the whereabouts of the North Korean leader or indicate anything about his health but it does lend weight to reports that Kim is staying at an elite area on the country's eastern coast,\" the report said. Speculation about Kim's health first arose due to his absence from the anniversary of the birthday of North Korea's founding father and Kim's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, on April 15. North Korea's state media last reported on Kim's whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on April 11. China has dispatched a team to North Korea including medical experts to advise on Kim Jong Un, according to three people familiar with the situation. A third-generation hereditary leader who came to power after his father's death in 2011, Kim has no clear successor in a nuclear-armed country, which could present major international risk. On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump downplayed reports that Kim was ill. \"I think the report was incorrect,\" Trump told reporters, but he declined to say if he had been in touch with North Korean officials. Trump has met Kim three times in an attempt to persuade him to give up a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States as well as its Asian neighbors. While talks have stalled, Trump has continued to hail Kim as a friend. REPORTS AND CONTROLSReporting from inside North Korea is notoriously difficult because of tight controls on information. A Trump administration official said continuing days of North Korean media silence on Kim's whereabouts had heightened concerns about his condition, and that information remained scant from a country U.S. intelligence has long regarded as a \"black box.\" The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to questions about the situation on Saturday. Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that reports on North Korea, cited one unnamed source in North Korea on Monday as saying that Kim had undergone medical treatment in the resort county of Hyangsan north of the capital Pyongyang. It said that Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on April 12. Since then, multiple South Korean media reports have cited unnamed sources this week saying that Kim might be staying in the Wonsan area. On Friday, local news agency Newsis cited South Korean intelligence sources as reporting that a special train for Kim's use had been seen in Wonsan, while Kim's private plane remained in Pyongyang. Newsis reported Kim may be sheltering from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Kim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before. In 2014, he vanished for more than a month and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp. Speculation about his health has been fanned by his heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems.

      "NEW DELHI: Close to 6300 Indian nationals abroad have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, posing a serious logistical challenge to the government as and when it decides to evacuate Indians stranded overseas. The number has almost doubled in the past 8-9 days as it stood at 3,336 on April 16. The number of deaths of Indian nationals caused by Covid-19 abroad has also shot up to 40 from 25 during this period, official sources told ToI. The infections are spread over 50 countries. Singapore and Gulf countries together account for more than 50 per cent of the infections. Singapore, in fact, has now taken over from Kuwait as the country where the highest number of Indians - more than a thousand - are infected. Coronavirus pandemic: Complete CoverageHow to quarantine yourself at homeTrust the newspaper for your daily verified newsOfficial sources here said almost 90 per cent of Indians infected in Singapore were workers living in dormitories for foreign workers. They said the spread within the dormitories was expected. The Singapore government is said to be providing all medical and other assistance to the workers. Indian high commissioner Jawed Ashraf had earlier this month visited one of the dormitories where thousands of Indian workers live. Well over 2000 Indians have also been infected in Gulf countries like Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE. Hundreds of Indians are also infected in Iran. The jump in number of those infected - from 3336 to 6300 - in a little over a week is significant. The foreign ministry had first said in Parliament on March 18 that 276 Indians had contracted Covid-19 overseas. However, 255 of those were only in Iran, one of the worst hit countries. It took a month for the number to increase to 3336, as the government confirmed on April 16. After that though, it has taken the number just 9 days to shoot up to almost 6300. While the Indian missions remain in touch with local authorities to ensure proper treatment for Indian Covid-19 patients, it remains open to speculation whether or not they can return to India anytime soon. The government has so far avoided bringing back from abroad Indian nationals who tested positive for Covid-19. It has said that this is not because India lacks quarantine facilities but because of the extremely infectious nature of the disease and the risk involved in their travelling. The government, in fact, stopped operating evacuation flights altogether after the lockdown, asking indian citizens in advisories across the world - from southeast Asia to Europe - to remain where they were because of the lockdown in India.
